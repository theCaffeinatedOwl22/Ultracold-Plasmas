	abstract = {By photoionizing samples of laser-cooled atoms with laser light tuned just above the ionization limit, plasmas can be created with electron and ion temperatures below 10 K. These ultracold neutral plasmas have extended the temperature bounds of plasma physics by two orders of magnitude. Table-top experiments, using many of the tools from atomic physics, allow for the study of plasma phenomena in this new regime with independent control over the density and temperature of the plasma through the excitation process. Characteristic of these systems is an inhomogeneous density profile, inherited from the density distribution of the laser-cooled neutral atom sample. Most work has dealt with unconfined plasmas in vacuum, which expand outward at velocities of order 100 m/s, governed by electron pressure, and with lifetimes of order 100 μs, limited by stray electric fields. Using detection of charged particles and optical detection techniques, a wide variety of properties and phenomena have been observed, including expansion dynamics, collective excitations in both the electrons and ions, and collisional properties. Through three-body recombination collisions, the plasmas rapidly form Rydberg atoms, and clouds of cold Rydberg atoms have been observed to spontaneously avalanche ionize to form plasmas. Of particular interest is the possibility of the formation of strongly coupled plasmas, where Coulomb forces dominate thermal motion and correlations become important. The strongest impediment to strong coupling is disorder-induced heating, a process in which Coulomb energy from an initially disordered sample is converted into thermal energy. This restricts electrons to a weakly coupled regime and leaves the ions barely within the strongly coupled regime. This review will give an overview of the field of ultracold neutral plasmas, from its inception in 1999 to current work, including efforts to increase strong coupling and effects on plasma properties due to strong coupling.},

In appropriately scaled units, interactions are characterized entirely by a screening parameter, κ. As a result, systems of similar κ show the same dynamics, regardless of the underlying parameters (e.g., density and temperature). We demonstrate this behavior using ultracold neutral plasmas (UNPs) created by photoionizing a cold (T≤10 mK) gas. The ions in UNP systems are well described by the Yukawa model, with the electrons providing the screening. Creation of the plasma through photoionization can be thought of as a rapid quench of the interaction potential from κ=∞ to a final κ value set by the electron density and temperature. We demonstrate experimentally that the postquench dynamics are universal in κ over a factor of 30 in density and an order of magnitude in temperature. Results are compared with molecular-dynamics simulations. We also demonstrate that features of the postquench kinetic energy evolution, such as disorder-induced heating and kinetic-energy oscillations, can be used to determine the plasma density and the electron temperature.},

	abstract = {Making a strongly coupled plasma
Plasmas—gases of ionized atoms and electrons—are naturally formed at high temperatures, such as those reached in the interiors of stars. Describing plasmas theoretically is tricky when they are in the strongly coupled regime; reaching that regime in the laboratory would provide a valuable benchmark for theory. To that end, Langin et al. worked with a cold plasma created out of atoms of strontium that were ionized by laser light (see the Perspective by Bergeson). They used lasers to cool the ions down to about 50 millikelvin, reaching the desired strongly coupled regime.
Science, this issue p. 61; see also p. 33
Laser cooling of a neutral plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state. By using an ultracold neutral plasma created by photoionization of an ultracold atomic gas, we avoid this obstacle and demonstrate laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma. After 135 microseconds of cooling, we observed a reduction in ion temperature by up to a factor of four, with the temperature reaching as low as 50(4) millikelvin. This pushes laboratory studies of neutral plasmas deeper into the strongly coupled regime, beyond the limits of validity of current kinetic theories for calculating transport properties. The same optical forces also retard the plasma expansion, opening avenues for neutral-plasma confinement and manipulation.
Strontium ions in a neutral plasma created by photoionization were cooled to {\textasciitilde}50 mK, reaching the strongly coupled regime.

In contrast to collisionless systems, in which the quantum dynamics of multilevel, laser-driven particles with spontaneous emission can be described with the optical Bloch equations (OBEs), particle velocities in sufficiently collisional systems change on timescales comparable to those of the laser-induced, quantum-state dynamics. These transient velocity changes can cause the time-averaged velocity dependence of the quantum state to differ from the OBE solution. We use this multiscale code to describe laser cooling in a strontium ultracold neutral plasma. Important phenomena described by the simulation include suppression of electromagnetically induced transparencies through rapid velocity changing collisions and thermalization between cooled and uncooled directions for anisotropic laser cooling.},

A description of the expansionprocess common to all plasma parameters is given. After the escape of fast electrons from the plasmacloud, the excess positive charge is localized at the outer boundary, in a narrow layer. This layerhas a characteristic front shape with a sharp drop in the charge concentration. The charged layerretains the remaining electrons during the entire expansion process. As the plasma expands, thespeed of movement of the charged layer becomes constant and significantly exceeds the sonic speedof ions. In addition, the dependence of the radial velocity of ions on the radius acquires a self-similarcharacter long before the final stage of expansion. On the basis of the calculation results, equationsand self-similar solutions are obtained. General dependences on plasma parameters are determined,which are compared with experimental data.},

A characteristic ion acoustic timescale is evident in the evolution of the plasma size and velocity, indicating that the dynamics are reasonably well described by a model of hydrodynamic expansion of a quasi-neutral plasma. However, for low plasma density and high initial electron temperature, excess ion kinetic energy in the vicinity of the central density peak suggests signiﬁcant local non-neutrality at early times. Observations are compared to the well-understood self-similar expansion of a UCNP with an initial Gaussian density distribution, and a similar scaling law describes the evolution of plasma size for both cases.},

Imaging and spectroscopy based on both ion absorption and fluorescence provide accurate measurements of ion kinetic energy, plasma size, and the number of ions in the plasma. Absorption measurements yield lower signal-to-noise ratios because they are highly sensitive to laser intensity fluctuations, but the resulting measurement of the number of ions requires no external calibration. Fluorescence measurements of ion number must be calibrated with absorption measurements, but the measurements are less sensitive to technical noise sources. Spatially resolved fluorescence measurements also have the advantage of separating ion kinetic energy due to expansion from thermal kinetic energy.},

Such phenomena offer stimulating and challenging problems for computational scientists, and the physics can be applied to other environments, such as the interior of gas giant planets and plasmas created by short-pulse laser irradiation of solid, liquid, and cluster targets.},

	abstract = {Ultracold neutral plasmas formed by photoionizing laser-cooled atoms near the ionization threshold have electron temperatures in the 1–1000K range and ion temperatures from tens of millikelvin to a few Kelvin. They represent a new frontier in the study of neutral plasmas, which traditionally deals with much hotter systems, but they also blur the boundaries of plasma, atomic, condensed matter, and low temperature physics. Modeling these plasmas challenges computational techniques and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so the field has attracted great interest from the theoretical and computational physics communities. By varying laser intensities and wavelengths it is possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy, and charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements for comparison with theoretical predictions. Recent experiments using optical probes demonstrated that ions in the plasma equilibrate in a strongly coupled fluid phase. Strongly coupled plasmas, in which the electrical interaction energy between charged particles exceeds the average kinetic energy, reverse the traditional energy hierarchy underlying basic plasma concepts such as Debye screening and hydrodynamics. Equilibration in this regime is of particular interest because it involves the establishment of spatial correlations between particles, and it connects to the physics of the interiors of gas-giant planets and inertial confinement fusion devices.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present ideas that were part of the miniconference on the crossover between High Energy Density Plasmas (HEDP) and Ultracold Neutral Plasmas (UNPs) at the 60th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics, November 2018. We give an overview of UNP experiments with an emphasis on measurements of the time-evolving ion density and velocity distributions, the electron-ion thermalization rate, and plasma self-assembly—all just inside the strongly coupled plasma regime. We also present theoretical and computational models that were developed to understand a subset of HEDP experiments. However, because HEDP experiments display similar degrees of strong coupling, many aspects of these models can be vetted using precision studies of UNPs. This comparison is important because some statistical assumptions used for ideal plasmas are of questionable validity in the strongly coupled plasma regime. We summarize two theoretical approaches that extend kinetic theories into the strong-coupling regime and show good agreement for momentum transfer and self-diffusion. As capabilities improve, both computationally and experimentally, UNP measurements may help guide the ongoing development of HEDP-appropriate plasma models. Future opportunities in viscosity, energy relaxation, and magnetized plasmas are discussed.},
